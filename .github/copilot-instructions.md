# AI Agent Project Instructions

Welcome! This repository implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the MOCO API. Please follow the guidance below when contributing or generating code with Copilot.

## Repository Structure

- `src/` â€“ TypeScript source code organized by feature:
  - `config/` â€“ Environment configuration helpers.
  - `prompts/` â€“ Prompt orchestrations exposed to MCP clients.
  - `services/` â€“ API clients for MOCO endpoints.
  - `tools/` â€“ Individual MCP tools composed in prompts.
  - `utils/` â€“ Shared utilities for date/time handling and error reporting.
  - `index.ts` â€“ stdio MCP entrypoint.
  - `http.ts` â€“ Streamable HTTP transport wrapper.
- `tests/` â€“ Jest test suites:
  - `unit/` â€“ Isolated tests for config and utilities.
  - `integration/` â€“ End-to-end API client tests using mocked HTTP.
  - `http/` â€“ Integration-style tests validating the HTTP transport contract.
  - `mcp/` â€“ Reserved for future protocol coverage (currently skipped in Jest config).
- `Dockerfile` & `Dockerfile.http` â€“ Container builds for stdio and HTTP transports.
- `.vscode/launch.json` â€“ Debug profiles for both transports.
- `.env.example` â€“ Documented environment variables required at runtime.

## TypeScript & Build Conventions

- The project is ESM-first with `"type": "module"` and `module: "ESNext"` in `tsconfig.json`.
- Always code in TypeScript within `src/`; compiled assets live in `dist/` (generated via `npm run build`).
- Prefer named exports and keep modules side-effect free where possible.
- Use existing utility helpers (`errorHandler`, `dateUtils`, etc.) to avoid duplication.
- When touching entrypoints (`index.ts`, `http.ts`), preserve the CLI detection guard implemented through the dynamic `import.meta.url` helper for ts-jest compatibility.

## Testing Expectations

- Primary command: `npm test` (runs all Jest suites).
- Use `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:integration`, or `npm run test:mcp` when scoping suites.
- HTTP transport tests rely on `supertest`; ensure new endpoints or behavior changes include coverage in `tests/http/`.
- Keep tests deterministicâ€”mock external network calls via existing service abstractions.
- Run `npm run lint` (TypeScript no-emit) before submitting changes.

## Documentation Discipline

- Update `README.md` whenever behavior, environment variables, or client integration instructions change.
- Mirror new environment variables in `.env.example` with concise comments.
- Document new scripts or workflows inside the README "Quick Start" or "Advanced Configuration" sections.
- When adding prompts or tools, extend the relevant tables in README and include examples where helpful.

## Developer Tooling

- Debug via VS Code launch configurations: `Debug MCP CLI (stdio)` and `Debug MCP HTTP Server` (delegates to `npm run debug:http`).
- The `debug:http` script loads `.env` automatically; ensure local credentials remain out of version control.
- Docker images should continue to build with `npm run docker:build` and `npm run docker:build:http`; verify after modifying dependencies or node runtime requirements.
- The logger implementation should be done in `utils/logger.ts` to maintain consistent log formatting across transports. The default log level is `info`. The environment variable `LOG_LEVEL` can be set to adjust verbosity.

## Contribution Notes

- Maintain compatibility with Node.js â‰¥ 24 as declared in `package.json`.
- Keep dependencies minimal; justify new packages in PR descriptions.
- Coordinate any protocol-level changes with corresponding adjustments in tests and documentation.
- Respect existing TypeScript strictnessâ€”prefer explicit types and handle error cases gracefully using utilities like `errorHandler`.

## Development Workflow
- Commit changes with clear messages referencing relevant issues.
- Open pull requests against the `develop` branch for review.
- Ensure all tests pass and linting checks complete before merging.

## Aditional Guidelines
- When new environment variables are introduced, ensure they are documented in `.env.example` and `README.md`.
- For any modifications to the HTTP transport, validate changes with appropriate tests in `tests/http/`.
- Use the existing logging utility for any new logging requirements to maintain consistency.
- All the environment variables used in the project should be read through the configuration helpers located in `src/config/environment.ts` to ensure centralized management.

Following these guidelines will help ensure Copilot suggestions stay aligned with project standards and that the codebase remains reliable and well-documented. Happy hacking! ðŸš€
